# Problem
Could anyone help with an issue? Read README file please
Could anyone help with an issue? I decided to create a website using ChatGPT out of boredom, and everything was going well. However, the more lines of code appeared, the more problems arose. Now I'm completely stuck, and both I and the AI are at a loss. Could someone take a look at the code? The thing is, the website should have a black background with white text. Only 3 pages in total. There's an image at the top left to open the navigation menu. After selecting a page to navigate to, the screen should fade out, then smoothly display a loading screen with the word "Loading" on a black background, and a loading progress below the text. Then the loading screen should fade out, and the page that was supposed to be navigated to should smoothly appear.
